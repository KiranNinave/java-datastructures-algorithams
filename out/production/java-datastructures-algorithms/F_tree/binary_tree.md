# types of binary tree

note: type of tree can make influence of tree implementation i.e implementing tree with array or linked list

## strictly binary tree
1. every node have 0, 1 or 2 children
2. implements using only linked list because with array there is chance of memory wast

## complete binary tree
1. A binary tree is complete if every level except last level has two children and all of the node should as left as possible
2. can be implemented using array or liked list

## full binary tree
1. A binary tree is full if every node except leaf node have two children nodes
2. A full binary tree is also complete tree
3. can be implemented using array or linked list
